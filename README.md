Welcome to the SoC Design and Implementation course repository! This program coveres the full spectrum of semiconductor design, equipping participants with the skills needed to master the entire SoC (System on Chip) design process. From foundational concepts to real-world design challenges, this course offers a unique blend of theoretical learning, practical application, and professional development.

This repository will contain all the course materials, design projects, and documentation developed during the program. Start your journey to becoming an expert in SoC design!

Tools - Synopsys

Design Compiler : For high-quality synthesis of HDLs into gate-level representations.

IC Compiler : A comprehensive place and route solution ensuring optimal chip layout.

PrimeTime : For sign-off quality timing analysis, ensuring your design meets its timing requirements.

StarRC : The industry standard for parasitic extraction, vital for accurate post-layout simulation and analysis.

HSPICE : The gold standard for accurate circuit simulation, crucial for design verification.

Custom Compiler : Tailored for designing custom integrated circuits with precision and efficiency.

IC Validator : An essential tool for physical verification, performing DRC (Design Rule Checking) and LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) checks to ensure the design meets all manufacturing specifications.
