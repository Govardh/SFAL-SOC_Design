# SFAL-VSD-SoC-Design Program

This repository documents my progress and key learnings from the 12-week SoC Design and Implementation course. Here, you'll find a comprehensive overview of my work, covering everything from foundational semiconductor concepts to advanced project implementations. This course, guided by industry experts, provides hands-on experience with Synopsys tools 

## What You’ll Find in This Repository :

* Course Materials: Notes and key takeaways from each module.
* Design Projects: Step-by-step design implementations, focusing on both foundational exercises and the final real-world project.
* Specialization Topic: Deep dive into the area of semiconductor design that I’ve chosen to specialize in.

## Tools Used :

* Design Compiler : For synthesizing HDLs into gate-level representations.
* IC Compiler : Ensuring the optimal layout of chip designs.
* PrimeTime : Performing timing analysis to meet design constraints.
* StarRC : For precise parasitic extraction and post-layout simulation.
* HSPICE : Gold standard for accurate circuit simulation and verification.
* Custom Compiler : Used for custom integrated circuit design.
* IC Validator : Critical for physical verification, ensuring my designs pass DRC and LVS checks.
